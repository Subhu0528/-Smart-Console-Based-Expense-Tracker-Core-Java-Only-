# Smart Console-Based Expense Tracker (Core Java Only)

## Objective
This project is a console-based Expense Tracker built entirely in Core Java. It does not use Java Collections or external libraries and involves implementing custom data structures, file-based persistence, and real-world expense tracking features.

## Features Implemented

**User Registration & Login with simple password hashing.**
**Add Expenses with amount, category, description, date, recurring flag.**
**Generate Monthly Reports (category totals, total expense, highest expense).**
**Category Insights (most used category, average per category).**
**Savings Goal Feature with goal comparison.**
**Recurring Expense Tracking.**
**Sorting of Expenses by Amount and Date (custom sorting logic).**
**Data Persistence in .txt files.**

## Custom Data Structures

Since I could not use Java’s built-in ArrayList or LinkedList, I created my own linked list from scratch. This structure is used to manage lists of Expenses, Users, and file data lines.

➡️ How does it work?
Node class: It has a data field and a pointer next to the next node.
The MyLinkedList<T> manages a chain of these nodes.
**```** 
Supports:
-add(T data) → Adds element at the end.
-get(int index) → Access element by index.
-set(int index, T data) → Update data at a specific index.
-remove(int index) → Remove element at index.
-size() → Returns total number of elements.
-forEach() → For manual iteration.
**```** 
➡️ Where is it used?
-UserService: To store & search registered users.
-ExpenseService: To load and store all expens
-FileUtil: To read file lines into a custom list.

**```** 
2. MyHashMap<K, V>
   Needed a key-value mapping structure to track:
   - Total amount per category
   - Count of expenses per category
   - Custom “get or default” logic.

➡️ How does it work?
Array of linked lists (buckets) to handle collisions (Separate Chaining). Simple hash function based on key’s hashcode.

Supports:
-put(K key, V value) → Insert or update key.
-get(K key) → Retrieve value by key.
-getOrDefault(K key, V defaultValue) → If key not found, return default.
-containsKey(K key) → Check key presence.
-keySet() → Get all keys as a String array.

➡️ Where is it used?
-ReportService: For category-wise totals & counts.
-Category Insights: To find most-used category.
-Savings Goal Comparison: Stores user goals (optional).
**```** 


## 🧠 Approach
-All expense and user data are persisted in .txt files.
-Passwords are hashed using a simple multiplication-based hashing algorithm.
-No Java Collections are used. All lists and maps are custom-built.
-Recurring expenses are marked with a flag and shown during monthly reports.
-Savings goals are stored per user and checked during report generation.
-Sorting is implemented using a custom bubble sort on MyLinkedList.

## 📝 Sample Input/Output
User Flow Example:

### 1. Register
Username: Subhu05
Password: Subhu05

2. Login
Username: Subhu05
Password: Subhu05

3. Add Expense
Amount: 1500
Category: Food
Description: Lunch at Cafe
Date: 15-07-2025
Recurring: No

4. Generate Monthly Report
> Report saved as reports/monthly_Subhu05_07-2025.txt

5. View Category Insights
> Most Used Category: Food
> Average Spending: ₹1500.00

6. Set Savings Goal
> Goal set to ₹10000

Report File Example:
==== Monthly Expense Summary ====
User: john
Month: 07-2025

Category-wise Breakdown:
- Food: ₹1500.0

Total Monthly Expense: ₹1500.0
Highest Expense: ₹1500.0 (Food)

Expense Details:
- ₹1500.0 | Food | Lunch at Café | 15-07-2025
